Welcome to HMFast
=================

`hmfast` is a differentiable, JAX-accelerated Python library for cosmology.
It provides a fast framework for computing cosmological observables with automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration.

Key features include:

- **Lightning-fast computations** with GPU acceleration.
- **Automatic differentiation** for easy parameter derivatives.
- **Flexible cosmological modeling** across multiple frameworks.
- **Ready-to-use emulators** for common cosmological models.



.. note::
    `hmfast` is in active development and is in its early stages. 
    Please note that as the code and API inevitably evolve, users are encouraged to anticipate updates when integrating it into their workflows.
